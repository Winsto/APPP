# APPP

Bob and Micah Martin's [Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#][appp] is an excellent book. I often find myself
using it is my 'go to' reference on patterns and UML, even though I have other resources on those topics this book is a really
good condensed reference on a lot of key developer information.

However, at least if you are an experienced C# developer, you will find yourself mentally re-factoring some of the examples. Don't
get me wrong they all show exactly what is being covered in the associated text. It's just that you wouldn't, necessarily, write
your own C# code like all the examples, at least not today. I think some of the issues do reflect the data the book was written. 
Typically the issue is around not using generics; remember when .NET didn't have generics? I do; I really wouldn't want to have 
to go back to using ArrayList etc now :0|

With that in mind my intention is to put re-writes of some of the code samples here; as and when I get around to it :0)
